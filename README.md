## Proposal

### Title:
#### Design Tokens for Accessibility Settings: Empowering Inclusive Design with CSS

### Description:  

The Rhonda Weiss Center for Accessible IDEA Data is excited to host this breakout session on Design Tokens for Accessibility Settings. As an organization dedicated to promoting accessibility and inclusivity, we firmly believe in taking an accessibility-first approach in all aspects of the product development life cycle.  

IDEA stands for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. It is a federal law in the United States that ensures students with disabilities receive appropriate special education and related services to meet their unique educational needs. 

In this session, we will review our groundbreaking efforts to develop an open-source tool for generating accessible reports of IDEA data. Discover how design tokens take center stage in delivering essential digital accessibility accommodations to end-users. This interactive discussion will showcase the pivotal role of design tokens in ensuring inclusivity and usability in accessing and interpreting IDEA data reports. 

Design tokens serve as reusable and platform-agnostic values that define the properties of a design system. By harnessing the power of CSS with design tokens, we can enhance the inclusivity and accessibility of the user experience, particularly for individuals with multiple disabilities or intersectionality. 

We will explore the idea of utilizing CSS tokens specifically tailored to address different disabilities and user needs. We'll delve into the proposed tokens for digital accommodations, such as those for low vision, color-blindness, dyslexia, ADHD, deafness and hard of hearing, motor disabilities, cognitive disabilities, photosensitive epilepsy, aging-related impairments, blindness, and more. 

The session will provide an opportunity to: 

1. Discuss the benefits and challenges of using CSS tokens for accessibility settings. 

2. Share experiences and best practices in implementing design tokens for accessibility. 

3. Brainstorm additional design tokens and discuss their potential impact on improving accessibility. 

4. Explore ways to integrate design tokens into existing design systems and development workflows. 

5. Collaborate on strategies to promote the adoption of design tokens for accessibility in the web development community. 

Join us for an engaging and interactive discussion where we aim to collectively gather ideas, insights, and practical approaches for leveraging CSS tokens to enhance accessibility. Whether you're a designer, developer, accessibility advocate, or simply interested in inclusive design, your perspectives and contributions are valuable.
